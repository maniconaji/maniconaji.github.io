This study responds to the pressing need for sustainable energy production by developing and validating a numerical tool using the SWAN Third Generation model. Focused on the coasts of the Valparaiso region, it comprehensively covers wave mechanics, climatic characteristics, and model application. The defined grid of interest, data collection, and parameter processing culminate in evaluating wave energy potential. Robust validation confirms model accuracy using the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, University of Valparaiso, and TRIAXYS buoy data. Results reveal coastal influences on wave characteristics, highlighting the unsuitability of bay areas for energy projects due to their high variability. Stable sites show promising average annual energy production, supporting the broader application of this tool to other regions for informed wave energy planning.
