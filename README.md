- BSc in Environmental Engineering | Federico Santa María Technical University (_Nov 2019_)

## Work Experience
**Project Engineer @ The Technological Scientific Center of Valparaíso (_December 2021 - June 2022_)**
- Worked in multidisciplinary teams, with experts from IT to mining, to tackle digital transformation and process optimization challenges in Chile's mining industry.
- Managed four simultaneous projects, articulating tasks between IT and mining experts, creating schedules, participating in and leading meetings, and preparing reports.
- Analyzed data from the tailings pond of a copper mining company and used it to design a web platform in conjunction with the digital transformation area, which would enable better decision-making.
- Assisted in setting up, sampling, and analyzing data obtained from a sensor to determine the concentration of copper in an aqueous solution via image analysis. Additionally, he developed a Python program to automate data collection.
- Collected and analyzed data on the height sensor used in the solvent extraction plant to determine future actions with the team and external assessors.
- Contributed to gathering information to establish a baseline for a sensor to analyze bubble size distribution in a flotation cell.

**Intern @ DFM Consultores Ambientales (_January 2018 - February 2018_)**
- Helped gather pertinent information on air quality studies, including pollutant dispersion modeling, meteorology, air quality baselines, and
data analysis from observed and modeled data (WRF) with MATLAB and CALPUFF View.
- Collected information on chemical accident dispersion models, analyzed requirements, and operated the SLAB View.

### Data-Driven EEG Band Discovery with Decision Trees
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
